FiniteAutomata

The finite automata class is a finite automation which implements the operations on an automaton read from a file.
The file contains the states/alphabet/transitions/initial states and final states and they are kept in separate lists

Operations:
init : creating the lists after reading the FA file
isDfa : checking if the final automata is deterministic
isAccepted : returns wheter the input sequence is accepted by the finite automata

used:
non_zero_digit = "1" |...| "9"
zero_digit = "0" 
sign = ["+" | "-"]
intreg = zero_digit | sign digit {(zero_digit | digit)}
letter= a|b|..|z|A|..|z
character=letter|digit
