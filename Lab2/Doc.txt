There are two classes HashTable which represents the data structure and SymbolTabel which acts as a controller for the HashTable
Hash Table methods:
    - myhash: the hashfunction I used for hashing the keys
    - add: add mapping to a bucket which has it's index the hashed key
    - get: get a mapping from the hashtable using the key
    - delete: delete a mapping from the hashtable using the key
In asserting file I check if add/delete act as intended
