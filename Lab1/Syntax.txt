        The words - predefined tokens are specified between " and ":  
  
a) Sintactical rules:
    program::= "incepe" cmpdstmt

    declaration ::= type identifier

    type::="caracter"|"intreg"|"mare"|"array"

    declist ::= declaration | declaration {"," identifier}

    iostmt ::= "citeste" | "afiseaza" "(" IDENTIFIER ")"

    assignstmt ::= IDENTIFIER "<=" expression

    stmtlist::=stmt | stmt ; stmtlist

    stmt ::= simplstmt | structstmt

    simplstmt ::= assignstmt | iostmt

    structstmt ::= ifstmt | whilestmt | cmpdstmt

    ifstmt ::= "daca(" condition ")" stmt ["else" stmt]

    whilestmt ::= "cat(" condition ")" stmt

    condition ::= expression RELATION expression | condition {("si"|"sau") condition}

    expression ::= expression "+" term | term

    term ::= term "*" factor | factor
    
    factor ::= "(" expression ")" | IDENTIFIER
